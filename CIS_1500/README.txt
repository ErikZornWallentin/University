GENERAL INFO FOR ANY READER 
****************************

**IMPORTANT READ FOR USER**

This program was created during my 1st year of Software Engineering at University of Guelph.
It is a very simple script for an assignment in my CIS*1500 class.
Since this is a script I did in 1st year of University, this is not a current representation of my skill after graduating University of Guelph in Software Engineering.

The script is about getting dog information from the user.

The program will ask the user for several inputs and the first two need characters from keyboard.
Next the first input from user requires a first and last name to work properly, the dog's name does not.
After the user gives unput to the dog's name, everything else will require numbers for the program to work properly.
When the user input is done, it will do some background work and output all the data to the screen.
