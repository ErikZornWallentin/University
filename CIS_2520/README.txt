The programs were created during my 2nd year of Software Engineering at University of Guelph.
The assignments are based on the data structures class, you can get full details of what I did on the assignment with the pdf and README in each directory.
I did the scripts in 2nd year of University, this is not a current representation of my skill after graduating University of Guelph in Software Engineering.

Basic rundown of what the assignments were that you can see in their directories:

	Assignment 1:
					1) Write a C program that outputs all possible strings formed by using the characters
						’c’, ’a’, ’r’, ’b’, ’o’, and ’n’ exactly once.
					2) Ackermann’s function A(m, n) is a two argument function.
					3) Let x be a positive real. To calculate the square root of x by Newtons method, so
					   that the square of the solution differs from x to within an accuracy of ǫ, we start with an initial
					   approximation a = x/2. If |a * a − x| <= ǫ , we stop with the result a. Otherwise we replace a
					   with the next approximation, defined by (a+x/a)/2. Then, we test the result again. In general,
					   we keep on computing and testing successive approximations until we find one close enough to
					   stop. Write two C functions, using recursion and non-recursion respectively, to implement the
					   above algorithm. You should use a sequence of big real numbers and a small ǫ to test your
					   program, and try to find the differences in execution time.
	Assignment 2:
					1) Write a program in which linked lists are used to maintain the data structure for a
						car rental company. The program allows several types of transactions to be applied to the data
						structure in order to keep the lists up-to-date.
					2) An expression is in postfix form if the operators appear after their operands, for
						example, “1 2+” means “1+2”, and “1 2+5 3−*” means “(1+2)*(5−3)”. Write a program
						that evaluates postfix expressions composed of single digits and binary operators of +, −, *,
						and /, for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and devision respectively.
						The program takes an expression as a command-line argument, with no space in it, for
						example q2 12+53-*, where q2 is the name by which the program is invoked. The program
						prints a result that has two digits after the decimal point.
	Assignment 3:
					1) Write a C program that takes as input a fully parenthesized, arithmetic expression
						of binary operators +,−,*, /, and converts the expression into a binary expression tree. Your
						program shall allow for the leaves not only to store floating values but also to store variables of
						the form x1, x2, x3, and so on, which are initially 0.0 and can be updated interactively by the
						user. For example, expression (((x1 + 5.12) * (x2 − 7.68))/x3) will be converted into a binary
						expression tree like: SEE PDF IN ASSIGNMENT 3 DIRECTORY
					2) Write a C program. It reads 200 2-digit integers from text file “f.dat” and stores the
						integers in an array of 20 rows and 10 columns. The program treats each row of the array as
						an object, with the sum of the first three integers being the key, and the other seven integers
						being the information content. The program then creates a heap with a node containing an
						object. You are required to use an array representation of heap, and apply the parental node
						downheap algorithm. The program finally displays the heap as a 20 × 10 array, a row for an
						object.
	Assignment 4:
					1) Write a C program to implement the AVL tree paradigm. Your AVL tree implementation
						should deal with nodes involving a key and a count. The key is a character string, whereas the
						count is an integer which serves as the frequency count of the key. For example, if the same key
						has been inserted three times, then the count value should be 3. Your program should show a
						menu with the following options: SEE PDF IN ASSIGNMENT 4 DIRECTORY
