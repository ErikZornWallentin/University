**IMPORTANT READ FOR ANYONE**
I am a TA (Teaching Assistant) for the class CIS*1000 (Winter 2016 semester) and was requested to create an example website
by my professor (Zoe Zhu) for the students to see as an example site. The website I created was a specific format requested by the professor.
It is a simple website for the students to see as an example website and for them to learn from.

***VERY IMPORTANT***
If you want to see my skills in website design and implementation in a professional level please see:
http://www.rescast.com/     --> Type that link into your browser
This website I created full time for a company called Research Casting International, I created it by myself in a few months.
You can see my name on the website to show proof if you go to main page of the website --> About page (top middle) --> Scroll down till you see my name!
You will see:
