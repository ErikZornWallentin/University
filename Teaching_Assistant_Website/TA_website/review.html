				<p> <br><b>Want to try something new? </b><br>
				           We want you to find the unique traits of each weapon and defeat each boss based off strategy / specific boss mechanics. You can try to run up to a boss and spam a button but you will be punished for it. We want you to move around; Think a bit for every dungeon as the difficulty will quickly get harder and harder. It will feel very satisfying and evoke emotions to overcome the obstacles in Azmara. I am very excited to also show off our VERY dynamic multi-level map system that will make solving puzzles and killing monsters very fun!

				<p> <br> <b> When I was young...</b><br>
				             When I was young I was fortunate to have parents who owned their own video & video game rental store for over 20 years. Unfortunately due to the increasing accessibility of movies and video games, rental stores are now becoming obsolete [no more free video games!] During this time I had the pleasure to try out the various games created on PC and console systems such as Sega Gensis, SNES, N64, Playstation and Xbox at my leisure. Now comes the time of mobile. I have been molded by the entertainment industry and now that I am of age I see no better place for me to be.

				<p> <br><b>It feels refreshing! </b><br>
				           I miss the old Zelda series and it feels very good to play a game like I use to play on my old gameboy that gives me the same feelings I had when I was a child! The 2.5D feature is amazing, and the dungeons are very tough!
				           Games these days are too easy and it actually feels rewarding when you beat a boss!

				<p> <br><b>Finally a new RPG game that is not just hack and slash! </b><br>
				           Games lately have been only hack and slash and that gets very boring very quickly...I am glad I can finally play a game that you have to think about as you play it and the "puzzles" are also very challenging! I like how there are multiple "pathways" you can choose and doesn't feel like just a linear game.
