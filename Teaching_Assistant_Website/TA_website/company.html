				<h2><center>Mobile Game Development Company <br>
					        Small Business <br> </center></h2>
				
				<h3><br>Start Info: Founded on May 1, 2014<br>
					    Address: Elora, Ontario N0B 1N2<br>
					    Email: info@rollplaygamesltd.com </h3>

				<p><b>RollPlay Games Ltd. is a start up mobile-app company founded by Drew Mochrie and Erik Zorn-Wallentin.</b> <br>
				   <br>There are very few mobile games that capture the full RPG experience. 
					   We want to produce games that will give the same level of excitement that my team and I had when we booted up our Game Boys for the first time.
					   Our focus will be on creating apps for iOS and android phones/tablets. These apps will be able to perform flawlessly on "medium-end" phones and above.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Apps are built using the Corona SDK engine, Corona SDK supports iOs and Android phone and is a 2D engine. We use the MTE (Million Tile Engine) on top of the
					Corona SDK engine and this allows us to create "2.5D" with multiple other features included.
