Compilation
**********************

To compile this program make sure you are in the correct directory in the terminal for where your file is.
Next type gfortran a1.f90 -o a1 in the command prompt.
The assignment Fortran 90 file is called : a1.f90
The output would be called: a1

***********************
Running the program(s)
***********************

To run the program type "./a1 or a1" for the specific program, you need to first compile it properly as directed above. 
A prompt will pop up saying the program has started and you can exit at any time by typing "exit"
The program will loop forever till the user types exit.
When the user inputs information, it will output a result.

When the program exits it will say it is exiting the program.

*****************
Known Limitations
*****************

I was unable to get the stacks working properly and could not get the VPN to convert an algebraic expression.
I showed what I tried to work on and I tried to follow the flowchart closely and in the end could not get it to work properly.

The current program on the user end will simply print out whatever you gave as input till the user types exit.
It should have given a proper VPN from the user.
