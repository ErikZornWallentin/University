i. Does your simulator include switch overhead for the first ready state 
   to running state transition? Explain.
   
-My program takes in the switch overhead and if I got to implementing it fully, it would
have taken the first ready state and automatically switched it to a running state transition as it
is the first one given.
   
ii. Does your simulator include switch overhead if a thread moves from ready state 
    to running state and the CPU is idle? Explain.
    
-My program is setup to include switch overhead, if I got to implementing it fully it would
have grabbed the next thread about to be used and always switch it from ready to running state.
Also if the CPU is idle, which means it is waiting for the clock timer to reach the next arrival time it
calculates that waiting time fully and gives the CPU utilization.
    
    
iii. Does your simulator include switch overhead if a thread moves from running state 
     to blocked state and the ready queue is empty? Explain.
    
-My program is setup to include switch overhead from running sate to block state and ready queue is empty,
but I was not able to fully implement this. If it worked 100% it would have done as the question asks.
     
     
iv. Does your simulation include switch overhead if a thread is interrupted 
    (due to a time slice) and either the ready queue is empty or the thread has the highest priority? Explain.

-My program is setup to include the switch overhead if a thread is interrupted but I was unable
to complete this task 100%.
